This is not my first day on GitHub.
However, I'll type some some stuff here because I'm attending a Web Development bootcamp and the first lesson is actually a lesson about Git and GitHub.
Some keywords that are always good to remember are:
git
GitHub
version control
repository
commit
hash

I cannot really read what's on the screen :/
This is a bit random
