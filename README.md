# This is not my first day on GitHub
However, I'll type some stuff here because I'm attending a **Web Development bootcamp** at *Spiced Academy* and the first lesson is actually a lesson about Git and GitHub.
Some keywords that are always good to remember are:
- git
- GitHub
- version control
- repository
- commit
- hash
